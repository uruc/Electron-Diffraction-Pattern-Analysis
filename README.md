# Electron Diffraction Pattern Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive project aimed at improving the analysis of electron diffraction patterns through advanced image processing techniques. The project is divided into two main objectives:

## Aim 1: Develop a Graph Model for Point Detection

The first aim is to develop a graph model for accurately locating points in electron diffraction patterns. This involves:
- Detecting the center of the image.
- Cropping the image to a 512x512 pixel resolution.

Accurate point detection is crucial for proper analysis of electron diffraction patterns, expediting the process, and reducing human workload.

## Aim 2: Enhance Simulated Patterns to Mimic Real Data

The second aim is to enhance simulated electron diffraction patterns to make them more representative of real data by:
- Adding synthetic noise.
- Applying blur filters to the simulated patterns.

This enhancement ensures that simulated patterns closely mimic real data, leading to more accurate results when testing image processing algorithms.
